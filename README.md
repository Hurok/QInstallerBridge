Ever wanted to make your applications work with the flow but stuck with Qt's **Maintanance Tool** ?. I belive that updates should   
be just installed without any complications but that does not mean **Qt Installer Framework** is a bluff , its actually the coolest   
thing a vendor can have. With Qt's Installer Framework you can ship your packages to **Linux , Windows and Mac** with a cross-platform   
gui installer but the one thing that sucks is that Qt does not provide a auto update officially but it does have the **Maintanance Tool**   
which can **auto update**. Some cool folks used **QProcess** to communicate with the Maintanance Tool and that did work as a hotfix but   
I needed a solid and clean api to communicate with Qt's Maintanance Tool and thus **QInstallerBridge** was born.
